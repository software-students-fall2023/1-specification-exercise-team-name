They also expressed interest in the feature of auto submitting applications

**Their Frustrations:** 

- **Difficulty in Finding Referrals:** Job seekers find it challenging to locate referrals or connections within their desired companies, which can be crucial for getting their foot in the door.
- **Skill Matching Issues:** They encounter difficulties in matching their skills with specific job requirements due to variations in skill names, missing skills in job descriptions, and the need to sift through lengthy job postings to find relevant skills.
- **Dislike of Multiple Accounts:** Job seekers express their dislike for having to create multiple accounts with different usernames and passwords for each job application. This process is cumbersome and time-consuming.
- **Changing Resumes for Each Application:** Tailoring resumes for each job application is a time-consuming task that job seekers find frustrating.
